# Missing Error Handling for JSON Body Parsing in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling for JSON body parsing.  The `bug.js` file shows the flawed code, which fails silently or crashes when presented with an invalid JSON request body. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a robust solution by adding comprehensive error handling.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `node bug.js`.
5. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/user` with a malformed JSON body (e.g., missing a closing brace). Observe the server's response and console output (or lack thereof).
6. (Optional) Repeat steps 4 and 5 with `node bugSolution.js` to see the improved error handling.

## Solution

The solution involves using the `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during JSON parsing.  The improved code includes comprehensive error handling for scenarios like missing or malformed JSON, ensuring the application gracefully handles unexpected input and provides informative error messages.
